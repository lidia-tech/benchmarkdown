## BUG: changing extractor engine should close settings

Currently, if the user changes extractor engine with the config section opened (previously clicked "new profile" or "edit profile"), the config page stays on the old engine. Close at least the old engine's settings if the engine has changed from the dropdown list.

## Implement litellm based multi-modal LLM engine

1. Save each page of the PDF into a separate PNG file:

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

# Open the PDF file
doc = fitz.open("../data/input/lidia-internal/EDPB Opinion 12-2018.pdf")

# Choose the page (0-based index)
page_number = 0
page = doc.load_page(page_number)

# Render the page to a pixmap (image)
pix = page.get_pixmap(dpi=300)  # use higher dpi for better quality

# Save the pixmap as an image
pix.save("page_screenshot.png")
```

The dpi should be configurable.

2. Call an LLM model with an appropiate prompt ("Extract all text literally from the page" or something similar; experiment with it). Use litellm framework: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/completion/vision
